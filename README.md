# Optimization

Through the optimization course in the MSBA program at the college of William & Mary, I developed non-linear and linear programming skills and discrete optimization techniques. Using programs as accessible as Excel to more complex languages and tools such as Python and Gurobi, I applied these skills to optimize transportation roots, maximize profit, assess risk and more.

Summary of work:

Hw2: uses an R markdown file to answer questions about graph theory and applications, including adjacency matrix to list conversion, generating a minimum spanning tree, and applying shortest path algorithms to project scheduling. 

HW3: uses Excel to maximize earnings for companies given supply/demand constraints. Sensitivity analysis on the robustness of the optimal solution is also performed in the event that predicted supply or demand is off.

Hw4: uses Excel to solve linear optimization problems. Problem 9.3 finds the optimal placement of ATM machines to reduce drivetime for the customers of a bank. Problem 9.4 involves optimizing a TV schedule given constraints of the network to show certain programs. Problem 9.7 balances the cost/benefit of producing certain types of trucks at a production facility that can only produce one type of product each month and optimizes revenue under these constraints. And problem 9.8 optimizes the selection of a student's college courses given prerequisite and course requirement constraints.
