# Optimization

Through the optimization course in the MSBA program at the college of William & Mary, I developed non-linear and linear programming skills and discrete optimization techniques. Using programs as accessible as Excel to more complex languages and tools such as Python and Gurobi, I applied these skills to optimize transportation roots, maximize profit, assess risk and more.

Summary of work:

Hw2: uses an R markdown file to answer questions about graph theory and applications, including adjacency matrix to list conversion, generating a minimum spanning tree, and applying shortest path algorithms to project scheduling.
