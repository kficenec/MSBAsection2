# Optimization

Through the optimization course in the MSBA program at the college of William & Mary, I developed non-linear and linear programming skills and discrete optimization techniques.  Using programs as accessible as Excel to more complex languages and tools such as Python and Gurobi, I applied these skills to optimize transportation roots, maximize profit, assess risk and more.
